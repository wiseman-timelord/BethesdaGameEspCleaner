# BethesdaGameEspCleaner provisionally named "Oblivion Esp Cleaner"
**Status:** Beta

### Description
A multi-threaded ESP cleaning utility similar to the concept of "P.A.C.T" for Fallout 4, but now for all AutoCleaner supported Bethesda games using xEdit's Auto-Clean. This tool automates the cleaning process using parallel instances of xEdit specifically made for relating game (ie TES4Edit for Oblivion), significantly reducing time and effort when working with large mod lists. For those whom may not know, this enables cleaning of Esps that one may have as part of a large mod collection, which in-turn prevents random, crashes and issues, from uncleaned mods. 

**Features:**
* 1–4 thread parallel cleaning using xEdit-AutoCleaner
* Auto-blacklist to skip recently cleaned ESPs
* Error logging and real-time progress
* Automatic xEdit setup on first run
* Designed for future multi-game support
* Will run from, game subfolder or custom location.

.\Thread#\*  # <-- sequential folders with word thread for replication of AutoClean exe.
.\temp\*  <-- files generated by program, ie processing lists per thread.
```

### Installation & Instructions
```
1. Ensure you have either, `Powershel v5.1+` or `PowerShell Core v6+`, see relating Demo/Instruction/TroubleShoot video if this confuses you. (Windws 10+ users already have v5.1)
2. Ensure you have `Scripting Host` enabled, see relating Demo/Instruction/TroubleShoot video if this confuses you.
3. Download and Extract the BethesdaGameEspCleaner release into a subfolder of your game directory (e.g. `C:\Games\Oblivion\**GameName**EspCleaner\`).
4. Download the latest TES4Edit `.7z` from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/11536) and place it in the same folder as the program files.
5. Ensure structure looks like:

  **GameName**EspCleaner\
  ├── **GameName**EspCleaner.bat
  ├── PowerShellScripts.ps1
  └── TES4Edit*.7z

6. Run Setup by launching the `.bat` file as Administrator → select option `2` to extract TES4Edit, set up thread folders, and generate config → choose 1–4 threads based on your system.
- It will download the portable `7za.exe` from the official `7z` site, in order to extract the `TES4Edit*.7z` file, obviously it needs to do that.
7. Start Cleaning by running the `.bat` again as Administrator or just having returned to the menu, (if you have second monitor put command prompt into it) then select option `1` to begin processing ESPs...
- There is occasionally a mod that will pause the TES4Edit-AutoClean page open (AutoClean would otherwise do that anyhow), but, if there is an "Ok" on the bottom right of AutoClean click that or if there is no "Ok" button then press the `[x]` in the top right.
8. Review Logs: `oec_blacklist.txt` (cleaned), `oec_errorlist.txt` (failures); temp files and thread folders are auto-managed. 
```

### Notation
- This version is configured for **The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion**, but, can be adapted for and will be released on, other xEdit-Autoclean supported games like Skyrim, Fallout 3, and New Vegas.
- Done so far for, [Oblivion](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/55417).
- It should be possible to edit the psd1 to have more threads, then manually setup the additional folders. I would not advise more than 4, as it is untested, and I dont want to risk breaking something. Do so at your own risk.

### Development
- To achieve the dream of having a esp cleaner on each of the bethesda games that support it on nexus is not possible due to powershell script rejection, but, would I want anything other than powershell handling the parallel batches? 
- Alternates would be; to make it a do all bethesda games that have autoclean, type of thing, that would be excellent, but only present in Oblivion. I could convert it all over to python, then release individually, but this makes no sense because Nexus are not allowing me access to main account. 
- Sending people here with links would be confusing, suggesting versions of a program, that were branded towards a specific game, while main files unavailable.
- Is it still necessary to auto-blacklist certain files? These may have been fixed by xedit team, especially on older games? or we would have to check the mentioned side-effects, AI research may be inadequate to find fixed bugs for autoloot.

### Warnings
- **Epilepsy** - Processing phase involves repeating open/close of full-screen tool."
