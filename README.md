# BethesdaGameEspCleaner
Status: Alpha

### Description
Its P.A.C.T. for ALL BETHESDA GAMES compatible with Auto-Clean versions of xEdit....!!! Its shaping up that the user may put 1 xEdit Auto-Clean in each ".\Thread" folder, thus enabling dual thread processing of Esps.

### Preview
- The new dual-thread version (Yes its 2x faster than P.A.C.T.)...

### Plan
Currently its branded towards the testing platform Oblivion, but for GitHub will be special generic branded one, before that it must work how I want. There will be game braned versions for each game I can cover featured on NexusMods.
